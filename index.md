  <p>
Hi! I'm a PhD candidate in economics at <a href="https://economics.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT</a>, where I am supported by the <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/" target="_blank">National Science Foundation</a>. I research topics in labor economics, with a focus on socioeconomic inequality. 
  </p>

  <p>
<b> I am on the 2025/26 job market. </b>
  </p>

  <p>
Before starting my PhD, I worked as an investment banking analyst at <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com" target="_blank">Goldman Sachs</a> and a research professional at the <a href="https://bfi.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">Becker Friedman Institute</a>. I graduated from <a href="https://economics.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT</a> in 2017 with an SB in physics and an SB in materials science. 
  </p>

  <p>
I'm also a resident advisor at  <a href="https://next.mit.edu" target="_blank">Next House</a> and I was a student representative on the <a href="https://facultygovernance.mit.edu/committee/committee-undergraduate-admissions-and-financial-aid" target="_blank">MIT Committee on Undergraduate Admissions and Financial Aid</a> between 2022-2025.
