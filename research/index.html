Standardized testing and university access"> <summary>Abstract</summary> The use of screening algorithms such as standardized testing in university admissions is widely criticized for benefiting wealthy students and not accurately capturing the potential of low-income students. Does standardized testing inhibit opportunity? Our paper answers this question using a staggered elimination of pre-university testing requirements in favor of teacher-assigned grades in the UK. First, we find that low-income students become 3pp more likely to attend university, while enrollment among high-income students is unchanged. However, only 1 in 3 of these marginal students graduates on time. Despite this low graduation rate, students shifted into university see large private returns: they begin their careers at better firms and gain £50k—£100k in lifetime earnings, net of tuition fees. Second, we see upstream shifts beyond the university enrollment margin — affected low-income students are more likely to take academic-track subjects in high school and apply to university. Third, we show that standardized tests in our setting exhibit no calibration bias against low-income students, whereas teacher grades favor them. Taken together, our results indicate that switching from tests to teacher grades can expand opportunity for disadvantaged students even in the absence of calibration bias in tests. Our findings suggest that reducing testing barriers expanded educational investment earlier in the pipeline and delivered substantial long-run gains for marginal entrants. </details> <p><br></p> <h2 id="working-papers">Working Papers</h2> <p><br> <strong><a href="/assets/papers/Lowballing.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="paper-title-link">Firms Believing Women Get Less Means They Do</a></strong> <br> (with <a href="https://nancywang3.github.io" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Nancy Wang</a>)</p> <details data-title="Firms Believing Women Get Less Means They Do"> <summary>Abstract</summary> This paper examines an employer-driven mechanism behind the early-career gender earnings gap using novel data on MIT graduates’ job offers and negotiation process. We document three key findings. First, women receive lower initial compensation offers than men within an employer-occupation. Second, this gap is entirely concentrated in non-salary components—signing bonus and equity—with no gap in base salary. Third, we find no gender differences in job search, and women negotiate as frequently and successfully as men. These findings also generalize to a national sample of high-skill workers in a dataset from Levels.fyi. To understand these patterns, we develop a model showing that a small number of discriminatory firms leads <em>all firms</em> in the market to lowball women in equilibrium. This market-wide gender gap is sustained through outside offers and cannot be closed by changes in worker behavior. We validate this mechanism using an incentivized resume evaluation experiment with recruiters, where we find that firms expect —other firms— to offer women less. Our results highlight the role of firm behavior—rather than worker decisions alone—in perpetuating gender pay disparities. </details> <p><br> <strong>Friends in Higher Places: Can exposure to high-achieving peers raise university aspirations for disadvantaged students?</strong> <br> (with <a href="https://economics.mit.edu/people/phd-students/kartikeya-vira" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Kartik Vira</a>)</p> <p class="paper-block-md"><em class="paper-note">Draft coming soon</em></p> <details data-title="Friends in Higher Places"> <summary>Abstract</summary> Elite university access in the UK remains highly unequal: low-income students are less likely to apply to and attend than equally qualified high-income peers, limiting access to elite careers. We show that this gap is partly due to perceptions of social fit, and that exposure to past attendees can close it. Using national administrative data, we exploit "breakthrough" events when a school first sends a student to a university, finding in an event study framework that applications from that school to that university subsequently rise by 30%. These marginal applicants are lower-income than the typical student at their university, graduate at typical rates, and earn £4,000 more annually than matched control students, indicating that access induced by exposure can promote upward mobility. To understand the mechanisms for exposure’s effects on applications, we conduct a field experiment in British schools. Randomly assigning students to view short videos of undergraduates discussing life at a university raises intended applications to that university. The treatment shifts students’ expectations of fitting in and making friends at the university, but not of admission or graduation, and does not provide students with durable connections to the attendees that they could make use of at university, isolating exposure’s effects on social confidence as a key mechanism. Our findings highlight perceptions of the social environment at top universities as a central barrier to access and illustrate that scalable exposure-based interventions can address this barrier. </details> <p><br></p> <h2 id="selected-works-in-progress">Selected Works in Progress</h2> <p><br> <strong>Confidence in Ability on Job Search</strong> <br> (with <a href="https://maximmassenkoff.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Maxim Massenkoff</a> and <a href="https://nancywang3.github.io" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Nancy Wang</a>)</p> <details> <summary>Abstract</summary> Inexperienced workers may have incorrect beliefs or diffuse priors on their abilities relative to the broader labor market, which may lead to overly restricted job search. Can a credible ability signal to high-skill workers augment job search behavior and improve worker allocation across firms? We partner with a large online interviewing platform that screens workers for employers in the tech sector and identifies exceptional users as “one of the best-performing coders on the platform,” communicates this fact to the worker, and subsequently offers them access to interview with select firms. Using a fuzzy regression discontinuity design around the exogenous performance threshold used to identify these users, we find evidence of increased and more ambitious job search as a result of the signal. Workers just above the threshold are 20pp more likely to switch jobs within a year, with effects concentrated among workers with less than 5 years of experience. Workers from lower-ranked universities who did not previously work at an elite firm see improved labor market outcomes 2-5 years after first using the platform -- these workers are 21pp more likely to work at an elite tech firm and work at companies with 12% higher expected compensation. We find that more than 85% of job switches occur off-platform, suggesting that access to interviews on the platform did not mediate these effects. Instead, our findings are consistent with increased and more ambitious worker search after receiving a credible signal about their ability, particularly among groups that were previously less likely to have considered these opportunities. Our next steps include generating measures of worker self-confidence from self-assessment and video recordings of interviews and characterizing worker-firm match quality. </details> <p><br> <strong>On One Condition: The Welfare Effects of Unraveling in the UK College Admissions System</strong> <br> (with <a href="https://padajar.com" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Phi Adajar</a> and <a href="https://economics.mit.edu/people/phd-students/kartikeya-vira" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Kartik Vira</a>)</p> <details> <summary>Abstract</summary> The mid-2010s saw a rapid proliferation of offers to UK universities in which students were admitted regardless of their end-of-school test results, effectively shifting risk from students to universities. In this paper, we seek to understand the nature of this unraveling, with a focus towards universities’ incentives and the effects on students’ short- and long-term welfare using data from all UK college applications from 2012 to 2021. We find that these “unconditional offers” were given by lower-ranked universities and targeted towards higher-achieving students. Students with an unconditional offer are 4.5pp less likely to attend their top offer. This is consistent with students being shifted into lower-ranking universities and becoming “undermatched”. Simultaneously, college attendance increases; students with an unconditional offer are 12.4pp more likely to be matched to a college when compared to students with similar test scores and teacher evaluations. On the university side, these unconditional offers improve university yields and student composition, and correlational evidence shows that a university’s adoption of unconditional offers occurs in response to its competitors doing the same. We estimate a structural model of university offers to evaluate the nature of this competitive response and the implications for student welfare. </details> <p><br></p> <h2 id="publications">Publications</h2> <p><br> <strong>Trade Competition and the Decline in Union Organizing: Evidence from Certification Elections</strong> <br> (with <a href="https://faculty.som.yale.edu/kerwincharles/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Kerwin K.

We find that the swift rise of imports from China in the early 2000s led to substantially lower rates of union certification elections, both among workers in manufacturing industries directly exposed to imports and among workers indirectly exposed through their local labor market. Consistent with a simple model of workers' decision to seek union representation, direct exposure lowered the expected wage gain from unionization, whereas indirect exposure increased the cost of job loss, both of which discourage organizing. </details> <script>function gaEvent(t,e){"function"==typeof gtag&&gtag("event",t,e||{})}document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){function t(){const t=(window.scrollY+window.innerHeight)/document.documentElement.scrollHeight;e.forEach(function(e){t>=e&&!n.has(e)&&(n.add(e),gaEvent("scroll_depth",{event_category:"Research",value:Math.round(100*e)}))})}document.querySelectorAll("details[data-title]").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("toggle",function(){t.open&&gaEvent("abstract_open",{event_category:"Research",event_label:t.getAttribute("data-title")})})}),document.body.addEventListener("click",function(t){const e=t.target.closest("a.paper-pdf");e&&gaEvent("pdf_click",{event_category:"Research",event_label:e.getAttribute("data-title")||e.textContent.trim()})}),document.body.addEventListener("click",function(t){const e=t.target.closest("a.coauthor-link");e&&gaEvent("coauthor_click",{event_category:"Research",event_label:(e.getAttribute("data-paper")||"Unknown paper")+" \u2192 "+(e.getAttribute("data-coauthor")||e.textContent.trim())})});const e=[.25,.5,.75,1];let n=new Set;document.addEventListener("scroll",t,{passive:!0}),window.addEventListener("load",t),window.addEventListener("resize",t)});</script> <script>document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){document.querySelectorAll("details").forEach(function(e){e.addEventListener("toggle",function(){if(e.open){const n=e.previousElementSibling?e.previousElementSibling.innerText:"Unnamed abstract";gtag("event","abstract_open",{event_category:"Research",event_label:n.trim()})}})})});</script> </div> </main> </div> </body> </html>
